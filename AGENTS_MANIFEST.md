## üìÑ DOCUMENTATION FILES (NOT AGENTS)
These files are documentation and should NOT be treated as agents:

- `README.md` - Repository documentation
- `AGENTS_MANIFEST.md` - This file
- Any other `.md` files not listed above

## üéØ AGENT IDENTIFICATION RULES

A file is an AGENT if and only if:
1. It is explicitly listed in the AGENT FILES section above
2. It contains a `## Role` section defining the agent's expertise
3. It starts with "You are" describing the agent's role

## ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT MODIFY AGENT FILENAMES
The agent filenames in this repository are the canonical source. They should NOT be renamed.
The mapping to Claude Code names happens during the sync process only.

## üîß SYNC PROCESS
```bash
./sync.sh
```
This script reads the agent files listed above and copies them to `~/.claude/agents/` with:
- Proper name mapping as shown above
- Required YAML frontmatter for Claude Code
- All agents get `tools: ["*"]` access
